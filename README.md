# Satellite Image Processing, Clustering and  Classification Tool
Project that uses Sentinel-2 data and demonstrates three machine learning techniques
to make conclusions about the areas captured by the imagery.

See Jupyter notebooks for Examples.
<br/>

___
##  Techniques
	1. Unsupervised/Clustering techniques (K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models) to give quick overviews of areas. 
    2. Traditional Supervised techniques (random forests, logistic regression & nearest centroids) applied to classified pixel values. 
    3. Writing and training Res-Nets on Eurosat dataset wthe learned weights to classify patches of unseen large imagery.
